## Selftester Plugin

- handle space in street name, number and zip code with gtm (gets encoded for some reason)
- check lampenwelt (zip from emine) no AWIN.Tracking.Sale but banner visible
- add button to manually add master tag again, to verify if its due to master tag before sales tracking
- improve overlay loading speed
